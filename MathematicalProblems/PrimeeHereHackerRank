Solution:


import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=scan.nextInt();
        int count=0;
        int flag=0;
        int i=2;
        while(i<=n){
            for(int j=2;j<=Math.sqrt(i);j++){
                if((i%j)==0){
                    flag=1;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if(flag==0){
                count++;
            }
             else if(flag==1){
                flag=0;
            }
            i++;
        }
      System.out.println(count);
        
        
    }
}
